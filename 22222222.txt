You wake up with a cough or a runny nose and you have to make a tough call, stay home for a day of Netflix, chicken soup or tough it out and head to the office. At least a quarter of American workers will choose the latter, according to a survey by NSF International, a public health and safety organization. The top raesons for heading to work while sick were the fear of having too much work to make up after a day away, and not being able to afford to take unpaid sick leave.
